# Data Science Project Portfolio â€“ Mariana Lira

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of real-world data science projects, built to solve practical problems using public datasets and industry-relevant tools.

Each project demonstrates my experience with the **end-to-end data pipeline**: from data extraction and preprocessing, to modeling, deployment, and visualization.
